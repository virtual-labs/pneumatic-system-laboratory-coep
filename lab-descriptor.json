  "objective": " Pneumatic system has been widely used in manufacturing industry. So engineering students must get
  exposure to pneumatic system. So we are planning to develop pneumatic simulator where all
  pneumatic components will be available to students. We will be referring standard for building
  pneumatic symbols. Students must be able to design the pneumatic set up for practical application.

  These virtual laboratories allow students to learn pneumatic systems anytime and at anyplace.
  Students can select pneumatic components as if they are in a real laboratory, design the
  pneumatic circuits and test the results to practical situations. Each student has his/her own virtual
  experiment to design the pneumatic system.",
